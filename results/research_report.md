# Real-Time Cursor Control Using Hand Gestures with Vision Transformer

*Date: April 28, 2026*

---

## Abstract

This project presents a real-time gesture-controlled cursor system using a
Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core classification model. Webcam input is
processed by MediaPipe for hand detection and ROI extraction. The ViT model
classifies the hand region into one of 7 gesture classes,
which are then mapped to cursor actions (move, click, scroll, drag) via
PyAutoGUI.

**Results:**
- Test Accuracy:  100.00% (if available)
- Inference FPS:  22.6 (if available)
- Avg Latency:    44.16 ms (if available)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Traditional human-computer interaction relies on physical input devices such as
mice and keyboards. These create barriers for users with motor disabilities and
limit natural gesture-based interaction.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
The system must:
- Detect hand gestures in real time via webcam
- Classify gestures accurately using a Vision Transformer
- Translate gestures into cursor actions with low latency (<100 ms)

### 1.3 Objectives
1. Build a real-time hand gesture recognition system using webcam input
2. Implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier with ImageNet pretraining
3. Evaluate performance using Accuracy, F1-score, FPS, and Latency
4. Deploy a working gesture-controlled cursor system

### 1.4 Contributions
- A modular, end-to-end ViT-based gesture control pipeline
- Two-phase fine-tuning strategy (head-only → full backbone)
- Real-time cursor control via PyAutoGUI

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Vision Transformers
Vision Transformers (ViTs) adapt the transformer architecture from NLP to
computer vision by dividing images into fixed-size patches, embedding them as
tokens, and processing them with multi-head self-attention (MHSA). ViTs capture
global spatial context from the first layer, which is advantageous for
distinguishing similar hand gestures.

### 2.2 Hand Gesture Recognition
MediaPipe Hands (Google) provides real-time hand landmark detection and bounding
box extraction using a lightweight ML pipeline. Combined with a ViT classifier,
it enables accurate gesture recognition without specialized hardware.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture

```
Webcam → Frame Capture (OpenCV) → Hand Detection (MediaPipe)
    → ROI Extraction → Preprocessing (224×224, ImageNet norm)
    → Vision Transformer Inference
    → Gesture Classification → Action Mapping → Cursor Control (PyAutoGUI)
```

### 3.2 Dataset

**Gesture Classes:** 7 classes

| Class | Gesture | Cursor Action |
|-------|---------|--------------:|
| 0 | Open Palm | move_cursor |
| 1 | Index Point | left_click |
| 2 | Two Fingers Up | right_click |
| 3 | Fist | neutral |
| 4 | Pinch | drag |
| 5 | Three Fingers Up | scroll_up |
| 6 | Three Fingers Down | scroll_down |

- **Collection:** Custom images captured via webcam using MediaPipe hand ROI extraction
- **Split:** 70% train / 15% validation / 15% test (stratified)
- **Augmentation:** Random flip, rotation (±15°), color jitter, Gaussian blur

### 3.3 Vision Transformer Architecture

```
Input (3×224×224)
  → Patch Embedding (16×16 patches → 196 tokens)
  → [CLS] Token + Positional Encoding
  → Transformer Encoder × 12 layers (MHSA + MLP)
  → [CLS] Output → Classification Head → 7 classes
```

- **Base Model:** vit_base_patch16_224 (pretrained on ImageNet-21k)
- **Parameters:** ~86 Million
- **Training Phase 1:** Freeze backbone — train classification head only (5 epochs)
- **Training Phase 2:** Unfreeze backbone — full fine-tuning with 10× lower LR
- **Optimizer:** AdamW (LR=0.0001, weight_decay=0.0001)
- **Scheduler:** CosineAnnealingLR
- **Loss:** CrossEntropyLoss (label_smoothing=0.1)

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 ViT Strengths for Gesture Recognition
- **Global Attention:** Self-attention captures relationships between all finger positions simultaneously
- **Pretraining:** ImageNet-21k pretraining provides rich visual representations
- **Interpretability:** Attention maps can highlight which image regions drive predictions
- **Scalability:** Performance scales with data and model size

### 5.2 Real-Time Feasibility
For cursor control, the system requires ≥15 FPS. GPU inference achieves this
comfortably. For CPU-only deployment, ONNX Runtime or INT8 quantization is
recommended (see optimization/ scripts).

## 6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a functional real-time gesture-controlled cursor system
using a Vision Transformer. The two-phase fine-tuning strategy efficiently adapts
the ImageNet-pretrained ViT to the gesture recognition task. The modular pipeline
allows easy extension to additional gestures or cursor actions.

## 7. Future Work

1. **Lightweight ViT variants** (DeiT, MobileViT) for faster CPU inference
2. **Landmark-based classification** using MediaPipe coordinates directly
3. **Dynamic gesture recognition** using temporal sequences (Video ViT)
4. **Model distillation** to compress ViT into a smaller student model
5. **Edge deployment** on mobile devices
