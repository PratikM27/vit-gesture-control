## Module Breakdown

---

### 1. Input — Webcam

**What:** Captures real-time video frames from the system webcam.

**Why:** Provides a low-cost, ubiquitous input source without specialized hardware.

**How:**
- Uses `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` from OpenCV.
- Reads frames in BGR format, converts to RGB for MediaPipe.
- Target frame rate: 30 FPS capture.

**Trade-offs:**
| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| Lighting sensitivity | Performance degrades in low light |
| Resolution | Higher resolution = more detail but slower processing |
| Decision | Use 640×480 resolution as a balanced default |

### 2. Hand Detection — MediaPipe

**What:** Detects the hand in the frame and extracts 21 3D landmarks.

**Why:**
- Pre-trained, highly optimized by Google.
- Runs on CPU efficiently without a GPU.
- Eliminates the need to train a custom hand detector from scratch.

**How:**
- `mediapipe.solutions.hands` detects up to 2 hands per frame.
- Returns 21 (x, y, z) landmark coordinates normalized to [0, 1].
- Bounding box is derived from landmark extents to crop the hand Region of Interest (ROI).

**Decision:** Use only single-hand detection to simplify gesture mapping and reduce processing overhead.

**Trade-offs:**
| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | Very high for standard lighting conditions |
| Speed | Real-time capable on CPU |
| Limitation | Fails with heavy occlusion or extreme angles |

---

### 3. Preprocessing

**What:** Prepares the detected hand region for the classification model.

**Why:** Raw frames contain background noise; models perform better on clean, normalized inputs.

**How:**
1. Crop hand ROI from the full frame using MediaPipe bounding box.
2. Resize to model input size:
   - ViT: `224×224`
3. Normalize pixel values using ImageNet mean and std.
4. Convert to tensor format.

**Trade-offs:**
| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| Input Size (224×224) | High accuracy for ViT, moderate compute cost |

---

### 4. Model — Vision Transformer (ViT)

**What:** Classifies the preprocessed hand image into one of N gesture classes.

**Why:** Vision Transformers provide state-of-the-art accuracy by attending to global context across the image.

**How:**
- ViT-Base-Patch16-224 pretrained on ImageNet is fine-tuned on custom gesture data.
- Output: softmax probability vector → argmax → gesture class label.

*(See `models.md` for full architecture details.)*

### 5. Gesture Mapping

**What:** Translates a predicted gesture class label into a cursor action.

**Why:** Bridges AI output to OS-level interaction.

**How:**

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| Open Palm | Move cursor |
| Index Finger Point | Left click |
| Two Fingers Up | Right click |
| Fist | Stop / Neutral |
| Pinch | Drag |
| Three Fingers Up | Scroll up |
| Three Fingers Down | Scroll down |

- Gesture label from model → lookup in action dictionary → call PyAutoGUI function.

---

### 6. Cursor Control — PyAutoGUI

**What:** Executes OS-level mouse and cursor actions.

**Why:** Cross-platform library for programmatic GUI automation; simple API.

**How:**
- `pyautogui.moveTo(x, y)` — maps hand position to screen coordinates.
- `pyautogui.click()` — triggers left click.
- `pyautogui.rightClick()` — triggers right click.
- `pyautogui.scroll(n)` — scrolls up/down.
- Coordinate mapping: hand x/y (normalized 0–1) → scaled to screen resolution.

**Trade-offs:**
| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| Smoothing | Raw hand movement is jittery; apply moving average filter |
| Fail-safe | PyAutoGUI has a corner-exit failsafe enabled by default |
| Latency | Each PyAutoGUI call adds ~1–5ms overhead |

---

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| MediaPipe for hand detection | Pre-trained, fast, no GPU needed |
| Vision Transformer (ViT) model | High accuracy and robust representations |
| PyAutoGUI for cursor control | Simple, cross-platform, no OS-level driver needed |
| OpenCV for video capture | Industry-standard, well-documented |
| Single-hand detection only | Reduces complexity; sufficient for cursor control |

---

## Overall Trade-offs

| Trade-off | ViT |
|---|---|
| Inference Speed | Moderate (~15–30 FPS on GPU, slower on CPU) |
| Accuracy | Very High (with enough data) |
| Hardware Requirement | GPU recommended for training and fast inference |
| Model Size | Large (~86M parameters) |
| Real-time Suitability | Good (with optimizations like ONNX/Quantization) |
